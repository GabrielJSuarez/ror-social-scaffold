## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps.

### Prerequisites

Ruby: 2.6.3
Rails: 5.2.3
Postgres: >=9.5

### Setup

Instal gems with:

`bundle install`

Setup database with:

`rails db:create`
`rails db:migrate`

Note: if you're working with a fresh installation remember to install Postgres locally and it's dependencies, also create a Super User that can access all databases.


### Github Actions

To make sure the linters' checks using Github Actions work properly, you should follow the next steps:

1. On your recently forked repo, enable the GitHub Actions in the Actions tab.
2. Create the `feature/branch` and push.
3. Start working on your milestone as usual.
4. Open a PR from the `feature/branch` when your work is done.


### Usage

Start server with:

```
    rails server
```

Open `http://localhost:3000/` in your browser.

### Run tests

```
    rpsec --format documentation
```

> Tests will be added by Microverse students. There are no tests for initial features in order to make sure that students write all tests from scratch.

### Deployment
